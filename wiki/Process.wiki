===Rules===

  # *Agile*: You need to be able to hot-deploy because you'll want to work with others remotely at high iteration speeds.
  # *Architecture*: The developer is responsible for all architecture and tools of the service. Restriction of freedom of choice and collaboration inside a service is strictly forbidden.
  # *Turnaround*: Maximum build & deploy time is how long it takes for you to switch to the test client. (1-2 seconds)
  # *Ownership*: The developer owns and is responsible for the service everywhere at all times.
  # *Errors*: Should be pushed from each live client to the service developers mobile phone in realtime.
  # *SOA*: One developer per service. Double-sided async HTTP is the only interface.
  # *TDD*: Test only what makes development slip due to complexity.

===Management===

  # 1 Minute per person "Skype" morning meetings, no other scheduled meetings.
  # No documentation, less configuration, more code!

===Simplicity===

  # Don't use libraries/tools that you can avoid. Own your libraries. Be pragmatic, new is not always better.
  # If persistence can be a file, make it a file!

===REST? (HTTP vs. HTML)===

  # POST --> 302 --> GET works, don't use PUT or DELETE.
  # Stateless is not required if you have proper load balancing.
  # Do not use the path for anything dynamic, it wastes CPU.
  # JSON > XML but HTML > JSON.

===Development===

  # Make the service describe it's own use: For example if you browse to /login without username and password the response should explain how to login or even better allow you to login! See example: [http://sprout.rupy.se/login sprout/login]; model: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/src/se/rupy/sprout/Node.java Node], view: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/res/jar/login.html login.html] and controller: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/src/se/rupy/sprout/User.java#207 User.Login].
  # If you don't require HTML fallback or login use XSS for modularity.

===Hosting===

  # DNS Roundrobin across backbones allows for 100% uptime. But this requires a new kind of real-time distributed [https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Persistence persistence].
