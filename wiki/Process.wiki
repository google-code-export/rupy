#summary How to build great server software.

Laws:

  # *Agile*: You need to be able to hot-deploy because you'll want to work with others remotely at high iteration speeds.
  # *Turnaround*: Maximum build & deploy time is how long it takes for you to switch to the test client. (1-2 seconds)
  # *Ownership*: The developer owns the service live.
  # *Errors*: Should be pushed from each live client to the service developer in realtime.
  # *_Single_ SOA*: You need to let your developers choose their own tools. One developer per service. HTTP is the only interface. If the developer quits you rewrite the whole service if it needs a change.
  # *_Single_ TDD*: Ski wax for the individual developer. Test only what makes development slip (when new code breaks old code) due to complexity.

Rules:

  # 1 Minute per person "Skype" morning meetings, no other scheduled meetings.
  # No documentation, less configuration, more code!
  # If persistence can be a file, make it a file!
  # Project lead should be stakeless.

Guidelines:

  # Don't use libraries/tools that you can avoid. Be pragmatic, new is not always better.
  # Make the service describe it's own use: For example if you browse to /login without username and password the response should explain how to login or even better allow you to login!
