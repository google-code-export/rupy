#summary How to build great server software.

===Rules===

  # *Agile*: You need to be able to hot-deploy because you'll want to work with others remotely at high iteration speeds.
  # *Architecture*: The developer is completely free to choose any software (languages and tools etc.) of the service.
  # *Turnaround*: Maximum build & deploy time is how long it takes for you to switch to the test client. (1-2 seconds)
  # *Ownership*: The developer owns and is responsible for the service everywhere at all times.
  # *Errors*: Should be pushed from each live client to the service developers mobile phone in realtime.
  # *SOA*: One developer per service. HTTP is the only interface.
  # *TDD*: Test only what makes development slip due to complexity.

===Management===

  # Developer works remotely as intimately as possible with the producers and consumers of the service content.
  # 1 minute per person (producer, consumer and developer) remote morning meetings, no other scheduled meetings.
  # No documentation, less configuration, more code!

===Simplicity===

  # Don't use libraries/tools that you can avoid. Own your libraries. Be pragmatic, new is not always better.
  # If persistence can be a file, make it a file!
  # If you need indexing, use the file system.
  # If you need full text indexing, use [http://www.google.com/enterprise/search/products/gsa.html google].

===RESTLESS===

  # {{{POST --> 302 --> GET}}} works, don't use {{{PUT}}} or {{{DELETE}}}.
  # Stateless is not required if you have proper load balancing.
  # Do not use the path for anything dynamic, it wastes CPU.
  # {{{JSON > XML}}} but {{{HTML > JSON}}}.

===Development===

  # Make the service describe it's own use: For example if you browse to /login without username and password the response should explain how to login or even better allow you to login! See example: [http://sprout.rupy.se/login sprout/login]; model: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/src/se/rupy/sprout/Node.java Node], view: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/res/jar/login.html login.html] and controller: [https://code.google.com/p/sprout/source/browse/trunk/src/se/rupy/sprout/User.java#207 User.Login].
  # If you don't require HTML fallback use XSS for modularity.

===Hosting===

  # DNS Roundrobin across backbones allows for 100% uptime. But this requires a new kind of real-time distributed [https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Persistence persistence].
  # Use dynamic "async non-blocking selector driven HTTP" server [https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/AsyncResponse response] AND client _requests_ to load balance your services.
*TODO*: Build new concurrent HTTP client tool.
