_If you want it all premashed for you, simply download the [http://rupy.googlecode.com/files/page-0.2.zip page] application, and run the *ant deploy* task!_

Let's create a rootservice (when you browse to "/") that returns 'hello'.
{{{
import se.rupy.http.*;
public Hello extends Service {
	public String path() { return "/"; }
	public void filter(Event event) throws Event, Exception {
		event.output().print("hello");
	}
}
}}}
Compile the Hello class above and put it in a jar file (hello.jar in the example below), then upload it in your ant script like this:
{{{
<target name="deploy">
	<java fork="yes" classname="se.rupy.http.Deploy" classpath="http.jar">
		<arg line="localhost:8000"/>
		<arg line="hello.jar"/>
		<arg line="secret"/><!-- see run.bat and run.sh -->
	</java>
</target>
}}}
Now try browsing to http://localhost:8000.

_Static content has to be placed under a service identifier path deployed in the same jar for it to become accessible, for example a jar containing /res/icon.gif will only be able to serve the image if there is a service with "/" or "/res" as path in the jar. This limitation exists so that services (except "/" which obviously can overwrite anything) won't be able to overwrite each others content._
