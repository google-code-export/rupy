#summary The usual hello world example.
#labels Phase-Implementation
Let's create a rootservice (when you browse to "/") that returns 'hello'.
{{{
import se.rupy.http.*;
public Hello extends Service {
	public String path() { return "/"; }
	public void filter(Event event) throws Event {
		event.output().print("hello");
	}
}
}}}
Compile the Hello class above and put it in a jar file (hello.jar in the example below), then upload it in your ant script like this:
{{{
<target name="deploy">
	<java fork="yes" classname="se.rupy.http.Deploy" classpath="http.jar">
		<arg line="localhost:8000"/>
		<arg line="hello.jar"/>
		<arg line="secret"/><!-- see run.bat and run.sh -->
	</java>
</target>
}}}
Now try browsing to http://localhost:8000.

_Static content has to be placed under a subservice identifier path (not "/") or deployed with the rootservice in the same jar for it to be accessible, for example a jar containing /res/icon.gif will only be able to serve the image if there is a service with "/" or "/res" as identitfier in the jar. This limitation exists so subservices (all except "/") won't overwrite each others content._
