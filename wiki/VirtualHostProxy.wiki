#summary Integrate rupy with your existing server.
#labels Phase-Deploy

How can you use rupy, if you already have something running on port 80, without having to invest in another server or an expensive firewall/router.

It's simple, virtual host proxy the requests through your current HTTP server, ie. redirect the requests to a rupy instance running on another port.

Below is an example Apache 2.2 vhost.conf.

This is particullarily useful if you need HTTPS!

{{{
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName yourdomain.com
        ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName rupy.yourdomain.com
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerName rupy.yourdomain.com
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/

        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key
