#summary Integrate Rupy with your existing server.
#labels Phase-Deploy

If you wan't to use Rupy for a module, but your boss want's to stick with your current HTTP server, you will then need to proxy the requests through the current HTTP server and redirect them to a rupy instance running on another port. Below is an example Apache 2.2 vhost.conf.

This is particullarily useful if you need HTTPS!
