#summary Integrate rupy with your existing server.
#labels Phase-Deploy

If you wan't to use rupy for a module, but you allready have something running on port 80 and you don't have an expensive firewall/router:

It's simple, proxy the requests through the current HTTP server and redirect them to a rupy instance running on another port.

Below is an example Apache 2.2 vhost.conf.

This is particullarily useful if you need HTTPS!
