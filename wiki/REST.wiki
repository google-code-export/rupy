#summary Why yet another Java HTTP server?

*Modularity!* _"Size matters, and less is more"_

Cutting the verbosity of the current Java HTTP landscape. I mean, for example, who ever said JSP should be bundled with every Java Web server, what if you don't need JSP? And thats just for starters.

When booting JBoss, WebSphere or WebLogic, you have time to get coffee while it initializes stuff you'll never use! Rupy is just HTTP in Java, plain and simple, on top of that you can add what you need... 

*Focus!* _"To the point design"_

At the end of 2003, Greg Wilkins, the author of the Jetty Web container and contributor to the Servlet specifications, blogged about some issues with Servlets: 

  * No clear separation between the protocol concerns and the application concerns. 
  * Unable to take full advantage of the non-blocking NIO due to blocking IO assumptions. 
  * Full Servlet Web containers are overkill for many applications.

Ona final note: _"WebServices are just XML Schemas over HTTP, but if you addup the electricity used by XML parsers and you can power a small nation"_
