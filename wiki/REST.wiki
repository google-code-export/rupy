#summary Why yet another Java HTTP server?

*Modularity!* _"Size matters, and less is more"_

 Cutting the verbosity of the current Java HTTP landscape. I mean, for example, who ever said JSP should be bundled with every server, what if you don't need JSP? And that's just for starters.

 When booting Java HTTP servers in general and JBoss, WebSphere or WebLogic specifically; you have the time to get coffee, while it initializes stuff you'll never use. With rupy on the other hand, the only thing you get is HTTP, on top of which you can add what you need...

*Focus!* _"To the point design"_

 At the end of 2003, Greg Wilkins, the author of the Jetty Web container and contributor to the Servlet specifications, blogged about some issues with Servlets: 

  * No clear separation between the protocol concerns and the application concerns. 
  * Unable to take full advantage of the non-blocking NIO due to blocking IO assumptions. 
  * Full Servlet Web containers are overkill for many applications.
