_"Size matters, and less is more!"_

*Modularity* 

 Ideally, you should be able to choose your tools and you should also be able to replace a broken tool with a new working one quickly. That's what modular software is all about, like binary lego. If you need a JSP compiler, _choose_ a JSP compiler!

*Handcraft*

 Or why not build your own JSP compiler? During all times craftsmen have always built their own tools. We strongly recommend that you be creative about how you solve _your_ problems, instead of relying on multi-purpose products, if it doesen't save you, it will reward you!

*Agility*

 With rupy you can hot-replace a major refactoring, if you serialize your user data to the session, without _any_ kind of interruption for your end users directly from your development station to the live environment. Let your users do the QA!

*Speed and Scalability*

 Why not have both, the compact size makes it easier to optimize the performance, which still gracefully degrades thanks to non-blocking asynchronous IO and an event queue to avoid selector trashing.

*Design*

 At the end of 2003, Greg Wilkins, the author of the Jetty Web container and contributor to the Servlet specifications, blogged about some issues with Servlets: 

  * No clear separation between the protocol concerns and the application concerns. 
  * Unable to take full advantage of the non-blocking NIO due to blocking IO assumptions. 
  * Full Servlet Web containers are overkill for many applications.
