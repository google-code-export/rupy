*Modularity!* _"Size matters, and less is more"_

 Ideally, you should be able to choose your tools. And you should also be able to replace a broken part with a new working one. That's what modular software is all about, like binary lego.

*Speed and Scalability*

 Why not have both, the compact size makes it easier to optimize the performance which still gracefully degrades thanks to the Java NIO package.

*Focus!* _"To the point design"_

 At the end of 2003, Greg Wilkins, the author of the Jetty Web container and contributor to the Servlet specifications, blogged about some issues with Servlets: 

  * No clear separation between the protocol concerns and the application concerns. 
  * Unable to take full advantage of the non-blocking NIO due to blocking IO assumptions. 
  * Full Servlet Web containers are overkill for many applications.
