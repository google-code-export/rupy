_First, [http://rupy.se try] the chat, it's the little black box in the bottom right corner!_

What if browsing wasn't a lonely experience? The real-time social web begins with Comet! We predict that in a few years time _every_ site on the internet will have a Comet application that connects it's users to share their common web experience in real-time over HTTP!

Rupy enables you to connect 10000+ concurrent users with one server, this number can scale to 30000+ depending on your application.

In web-browser context also known as 'Ajax Push', see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29 Comet] for more information.

Download the [http://rupy.googlecode.com/files/talk-0.2b.zip talk] application together with the latest [http://rupy.googlecode.com/files/rupy-0.2.4.zip rupy] and extract them to the same folder. Go to the talk/ folder and start rupy with either the _talk.bat_ or _talk.sh_ script depending on your OS. Then run _ant_ in that same talk/ folder, this should build and deploy the talk.jar application to your rupy server. Lastly, browse to http://localhost:8000/talk.html and chat in real-time over HTTP!

If you want to use rupy talk with apache enable mod_proxy and add something along these lines:
