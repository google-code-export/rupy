#labels Phase-Design
You have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code and make sure you do not include it in the classpath of the Daemon.

Common solutions:

# Implemented interfaces in separate jar and inner classes need to be public.
# Inner classes also have to be static
# All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
