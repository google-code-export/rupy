You have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code.

Common problems (in order of popularity):

  * Make sure the hot-deployed classes are not in the Daemon classpath.
  * All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
  * Inner classes need to be public static.
  * Implemented interfaces in Daemon classpath need to be public.
