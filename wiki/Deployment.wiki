#summary Common class loading pitfalls.
#labels Phase-Design

You have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code.

Common problems (in order of popularity):

  * Make sure the hot-deployed classes are not in the Daemon classpath.
  * Use Class.forName("your.Class", true, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()) instead of Class.forName(name) and only use this in the Service.create() method, you never know what class-loader your worker might have in the Service.filter() method!
  * All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
  * Inner classes need to be public static.
  * Implemented interfaces in Daemon classpath need to be public.
