#summary Common class loading pitfalls.
#labels Phase-Design

You have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code and make sure you do not include it in the classpath of the Daemon.

Common problems:

  * Implemented interfaces in separate jar and inner classes need to be public.
  * All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
  * Inner classes have to be static.
