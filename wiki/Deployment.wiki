#summary Common class loading pitfalls.
#labels Phase-Design

The classloader in rupy is very simplistic so you have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code. And what you store in the session with: {{{Session.value(Object);}}}, we recommend that you do not store hot-deployable classes there, since it will throw a ClassCastException if you re-deploy your application.

Other common problems (in order of popularity):

  * Make sure the hot-deployed classes are not in the Daemon classpath.
  * Don't use {{{Class.forName(String);}}}
  * All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
  * Inner classes need to be public static.
  * Implemented interfaces in Daemon classpath need to be public.
