#summary Common class loading pitfalls.
#labels Phase-Design

You have to be careful how you write your hot-deployable code. If your application needs instantiation by class name, use _Class.forName("your.Class", true, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())_ instead of _Class.forName(name)_ and only use this in the _Service.create()_ method, you never know what class-loader your worker might have in the _Service.filter()_ method!

Other common problems (in order of popularity):

  * Make sure the hot-deployed classes are not in the Daemon classpath.
  * All classes have to have a void attribute constructor.
  * Inner classes need to be public static.
  * Implemented interfaces in Daemon classpath need to be public.
