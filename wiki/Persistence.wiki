#summary Secure Unique Identity Cluster.

This requires latest [http://rupy.se/rupy.zip rupy] in hosted mode and [http://root.rupy.se/code Async.java].

For true redundancy you need to use some custom cluster database since we [http://host.rupy.se host] across multiple colocations!
Ordinary databases are not secure or redundant in a distributed cluster environment out of the box, but most of all:

  _Database clients don't use async HTTP; you can't scale them easily._

On the other hand modern file systems are now cheap and fast (ext4 on PCIe SSD).
See the entry on [https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Fuse fuse] to learn more on how you can scale any [https://code.google.com/p/rupy/wiki/Process ÂµSOA] cluster.
My first implementation of this cluster database will be a solution to user and node management with sort index and link graph.

_Work in progress: This current version is redundant for reads, but not for writes, meaning for example: If part of the cluster is down; you will still be able to login, but registrations will fail. The tradeoffs for write uptime are under consideration._

Try the [http://root.rupy.se latest] version.

<sup>1</sup> The root cluster database will not synchronize data for you after a failure, you will have to do that manually. It will however perfectly replicate and make sure nothing gets linked twice when all nodes are up.
